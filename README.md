The following repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the analysis on the coronavirus spike protein.

One of the most alarming features of the novel coronavirus was its efficacy in spreading from one host to another and the speed at which it was able to propagate itself throughout the global populace. As experts studied the virus, it was discovered that in many of the locales where the coronavirus genomic sequence was sampled, there existed an overwhelming presence of a certain mutation, called the D614G mutation, in the virusâ€™ spike protein. The spike protein is responsible for the coding of the crown shape that has come to popularly identify the coronavirus and its unique appearance. The spike proteins are what bind to host cell receptors, allowing the virus to enter host cells and begin the replication process. The D614G mutation occurs at the 614th amino acid of the spike protein. The amino acid aspartate (which is biochemically represented by the letter $D$) was being replaced by glycine (represented by the letter $G$) which led to the mutation being named the D614G mutation. This raises the question as to what makes the D614G mutation so much more infectious and the possible genomic differences that lead to it becoming the dominant strain.
