The following repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for the analysis on the coronavirus spike protein.

One of the most alarming features of the novel coronavirus was its efficacy in spreading from one host to another and the speed at which it was able to propagate itself throughout the global populace. As experts studied the virus, the presence of the D614G mutation was discovered in the virusâ€™ spike protein gene. The spike protein is responsible for the crown shape and allows the virus to bind to host cell receptors, enter the host cells, and begin replication. This raises the question as to what makes the D614G mutation so much more infectious than other strains. The goal of this analysis is to detect any significance that sets this mutation apart and see if these findings coincide with current researched studies.
